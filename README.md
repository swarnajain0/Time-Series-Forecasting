ðŸ“„ Time Series Forecasting using Auto ARIMA and Prophet
1. Introduction

Time series forecasting is one of the most important tasks in data science, with applications ranging from finance and economics to weather prediction and demand planning. This project focuses on forecasting international airline passenger numbers using two approaches: Auto ARIMA and Prophet. Both methods are widely used in time series analysis, with ARIMA being a classical statistical approach and Prophet being a more recent machine learningâ€“based model developed by Facebook. The objective of this project is to evaluate and compare these models on the same dataset, analyze their forecasting accuracy, and draw insights regarding their strengths and weaknesses.

2. Problem Statement

The goal of this project is to explore time series modeling techniques on a relatively simple and clean dataset. The dataset contains 12 years of monthly international airline passenger counts, spanning from 1941 to 1960. The data is divided into training and validation sets according to a 75:25 ratio. Specifically, data from 1949 to 1957 (9 years) is used for training, while data from 1958 to 1960 (3 years) is used for validation. The task is to forecast passenger counts for three years ahead using the training data and then compare the forecasts with the validation set. Model performance is evaluated using Root Mean Square Error (RMSE).

3. Dataset Description

The dataset used in this project is the International Airline Passengers dataset, sourced from Kaggle. It contains two columns: the month and the total number of international passengers in thousands. The data exhibits both trend and seasonality, making it a suitable candidate for time series modeling. The dataset is clean and does not require significant preprocessing, which allows for a clear demonstration of forecasting methods.

4. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Exploratory analysis of the dataset revealed a clear upward trend in passenger numbers over the years, along with strong seasonal variations. Peaks and troughs in the data aligned with specific months, highlighting seasonality effects such as holiday travel. These observations confirmed that forecasting models must account for both trend and seasonality to provide accurate predictions.

5. Auto ARIMA

The Auto ARIMA approach relies on the Auto Regressive Integrated Moving Average model, which is one of the most popular statistical methods for time series forecasting. ARIMA incorporates autoregression, differencing, and moving averages to model the underlying patterns in the data. However, selecting the optimal parameters (p, d, q) and seasonal components (P, D, Q) can be challenging and time-consuming.

The project made use of the pmd-arima library in Python, which provides an auto_arima function to automate the process of parameter selection. This function performs a grid search over possible parameter values and evaluates them based on the Akaike Information Criterion (AIC). The model with the lowest AIC is selected, balancing model fit and complexity. Auto ARIMA was trained on the dataset and used to forecast future passenger numbers, producing results that aligned well with the historical trend but showed some limitations in capturing seasonality fully.

6. Prophet

Prophet is a time series forecasting model developed by Facebook, designed to handle trend and seasonality in an intuitive way. It allows for additive modeling of trend, seasonality, and holidays, and is robust to missing data and outliers. Prophet requires minimal tuning and is user-friendly compared to ARIMA.

In this project, Prophet was applied to the airline passenger dataset. The model successfully captured both the long-term upward trend and the recurring seasonal fluctuations. The forecasts generated by Prophet closely matched the validation data, demonstrating its strength in modeling seasonal time series. Additionally, Prophet provided interpretable components of trend and seasonality, which made the results easier to explain and communicate.

7. Results and Evaluation

The performance of both models was evaluated using Root Mean Square Error (RMSE). Auto ARIMA provided reasonable forecasts but struggled slightly with seasonality. Prophet, on the other hand, performed better at capturing both trend and seasonal variations, resulting in lower RMSE values. This indicates that Prophet is a more suitable model for this dataset, given its inherent seasonal patterns.

8. Discussion and Conclusion

The project highlighted the effectiveness of both Auto ARIMA and Prophet in time series forecasting. While ARIMA is a powerful and well-established statistical model, its reliance on parameter tuning and its difficulty in modeling seasonality make it less convenient in practice. Prophet proved to be more accurate and user-friendly, particularly for datasets with strong seasonality.

In conclusion, for the task of forecasting airline passenger counts, Prophet outperformed Auto ARIMA in terms of accuracy and interpretability. Future work could extend this analysis by applying ensemble methods, experimenting with hybrid ARIMA-Prophet models, or testing the models on more complex datasets.
